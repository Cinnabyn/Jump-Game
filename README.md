# Jump Game 
## Concept
A puzzle game wherein the player simply needs to get from A to B. They do this by jumping on floating platforms or surfaces. These surfaces have specific colours that, when touched by the player, will do something. Examples could be a yellow surface that falls quickly after being touched, or a purple surface which will change the player's speed until another one is touched.

## Proposed engine
Unreal Engine 4. This is because I'm personally familiar with it -- The whole point of this game is that it builds off of a simple concept, so once we get that sorted then we can really go wild with things!
